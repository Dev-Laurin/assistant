//Ideas to go about this project: 


I think these are 2 different problems: 
1. Neural network to generate complete words, sentences - requires large set of correct audio files of sentences of natural speakers.

2. Neural network to generate sounds off a particular voice 

//Currently in the marketplace (doing the same thing):
Lyrebird - startup with 1 min of audio to be given to create a new voice with 
https://lyrebird.ai

DeepMind - Google's slower version

Questions: 
What type of neural network would be best for this? 

//Out there
This is a little out there, but rather than having an API where you give the NN words and it outputs those same words, what if we gave it meanings instead? (Intention)
